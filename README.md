# 🇮🇳 Tribute Page: Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev & Rajguru

This is a simple, responsive tribute website I created as my **very first web development project** to honor India's legendary freedom fighters — **Shaheed Bhagat Singh**, **Sukhdev Thapar**, and **Shivaram Rajguru**.

The page showcases their contributions, quotes, and a brief story, all presented with an aesthetic and clean layout.

## 📚 Tech Stack

This project was built using:

- **HTML5** – For page structure
- **CSS3** – For custom styling and layout
- **Bootstrap 5** – For responsive design and ready-made components
- **JavaScript** – For minimal interactivity
- **Fonts & Icons** – Bootstrap icons and Google Fonts

> This was the very first project I ever built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Since then, my skills have grown significantly, but I still cherish this project as the foundation of my frontend journey.
