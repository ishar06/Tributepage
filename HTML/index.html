            <h2>About Bhagat Singh</h2>
            <p>
                Bhagat Singh (1907-1931) was an Indian revolutionary and freedom fighter
                who played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule.
                He became an iconic figure of resistance and is remembered for his bold actions,
                including the 1929 Assembly bombing, which was intended to protest British colonial policies.
                Singh's powerful writings, his courage, and his ultimate sacrifice at the young age of 23
                made him one of India's most revered heroes. He was martyred on March 23, 1931.

                        Sikh family. His family was politically active, supporting the independence movement.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 12, Bhagat Singh was deeply affected by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, where
                        British troops killed hundreds of peaceful protesters. This incident intensified his hatred for
                        British rule.</p>

                        disillusioned with Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and started looking for more radical

            <h2>Bhagat Singh’s Writings:</h2>
            <p>While Bhagat Singh didn’t write songs, his writings, especially his essays and letters, reflect a
                revolutionary spirit similar to the tone found in patriotic songs and poetry. His notable writings
                include:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>"Why I Am an Atheist"</b> – An essay explaining his ideological beliefs.</li>
                <li><b>"Letter to Sukhdev"</b> – A letter written from jail expressing his thoughts on revolution and
                    sacrifice.</li>
                <li><b>"Freedom is now my Bride"</b> – In a letter to his Dad, Bhagat Singh clearly mentioned that his
                    life now is dedicated towards the freedom of India.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Even though Bhagat Singh didn't compose songs, his life and thoughts continue to inspire revolutionary
                music and patriotic songs in India to this day.</p>
